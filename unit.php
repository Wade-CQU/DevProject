                This unit will help you to consolidate your competence with a relevant set of software engineering concepts, practices, and tools. To achieve this, you will work in small teams with a designated customer to identify a problem
                and develop a software application adhering to software engineering principles and standards. You will document and present the requirement analysis, design artifacts, and the results from software testing.
                In addition to the documented application, your team will also identify and produce the project management and quality assurance components required to ensure that the project is delivered within specified project outcome parameters.
                You will also evaluate and discuss your contribution to the project team and the overall team performance.
